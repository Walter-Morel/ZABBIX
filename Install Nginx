Install nginx to Cent0S 7.

Step 1. With the root user we install the EPEL repository
  
  yum -y install epel-release
  
Step 2. Once this is done, we will update the information in the repositories and installed packages.

  yum update -y
  
Step 3. We now have the nginx package available for download and installation, which we do next.

  yum install -y nginx
  
Step 4. We already have nginx and its dependencies installed.
To start Nginx for the first time on CentOS 7 we will use systemctl start.

  systemctl start nginx
  
Step 5. we configure nginx to start automatically at every system startup

  systemctl enable nginx
  
command output: Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nginx.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.


##############

We check that nginx is running.

Step 6.

  systemctl status nginx
  
Output:

[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status nginx
